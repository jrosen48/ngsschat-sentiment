## possible RQs (from ed policy piece)

### ORIGINAL 

Research Question 1: How did the public sentiment toward the NGSS vary, if any, across all states on Twitter?  
Research Question 2: What was the topical structure in the NGSS discourse on Twitter?  
    - How do we look at topical structure? We could do a dictionary-based approach. or we could do topic models
Research Question 3: Who were the opinion leaders in the NGSS communication network on Twitter?  
    - Do we look at professional role? I think so
Research Question 4: How does sentiment differ between chat and non-chat time?

## pre-requisites for analysis

- identifying chats
    - can be messy
    - always a moderator - "welcome to #NGSSchat, please introduce yourself"
    - options:
        - hard cut-off: official end is 1 hour (usually/almost always)
        - gap - 5 minutes with no tweets, etc.
- determining sentiment
- identifying professional roles

## notes from 2020-06-29

- LIWC can also provide other information (different from sentiment)
- what is the unit of analysis? do we look within users? do we aggregate?
- first step: 
    - get familiar with the different sentiment analysis options
    - start with a smaller dataset - maybe just one year (2014? 2015?)
        - get a sense for how scalable/reliable things are 
    - for LIWC, CF can also purchase (https://liwcsoftware.onfastspring.com/)

    - pros and cons and ins-and-outs of sentiment analysis - Ben can share in OSF: https://osf.io/vk67n/
- tasks:
    - begin to explore some of the different packages
    - longer-term, split up sentiment and/or pre-requisites
