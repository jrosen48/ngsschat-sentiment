## Preparation of data 

`data-for-modeling-affect-ngss.rds` is created from `data_final_2020_09_02.rda` and a number of other (CSV) files using `preparing-data-for-modeling.Rmd`. **This step is not needed to analyze the data, as described next.**

## Analysis

Use `modeling-affect-ngss.Rmd` with the file `data-for-modeling-affect-ngss.rds` (from OneDrive).
